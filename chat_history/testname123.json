I'm here to help with any questions you have to the best of my ability. Go ahead and ask me anything!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "write a simple python script"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here's a simple Python script that defines a function that takes a number as input and returns its square:\n\n```python\ndef square(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Returns the square of a number.\n\n  :param n: The number to square.\n  :return: The square of the number.\n  \"\"\"\n  return n * n\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(square(4))  # Output: 16\n```\n\nThis script defines a function called `square` that takes a single argument, `n`, and returns the square of `n`. It also includes a docstring that describes the function's behavior.\n\nTo run this script, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `square.py`) and then run it from the command line using the `python` command:\n\n```\n$ python square.py\n```\n\nYou can also run the script directly from the command line by including the script's code in a `.py` file and then running the file:\n\n```\n$ python -c 'def square(n): return n * n; print(square(4))'\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."}]
